Fusion is a tweak that allows you to integrate multiple social networks into iOS. In the iOS 5 days when there was only Twitter support in iOS, Fusion came to the rescue and allowed you to post to multiple networks using the default Twitter integration. It allowed you to post to Facebook, Twitter, MySpcae and FourSquare. It also had an API that allowed other developers to add onto Fusion.
